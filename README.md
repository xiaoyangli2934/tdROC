# tdROC: Nonparametric Estimation of Time-Dependent ROC, Brier Score, and Survival Differnce from Right Censored Time-to-Event Data with or without Competing Risks

The tdROC package facilitates the estimation of time-dependent ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and the Area Under the time-dependent ROC Curve (AUC) in the context of survival data, accommodating scenarios with right censored data and the option to account for competing risks. In addition to the ROC/AUC estimation, the package also estimates time-dependent Brier score and survival difference. Confidence intervals of various estimated quantities can be obtained from bootstrap. The package also offers plotting functions for visualizing time-dependent ROC curves.
